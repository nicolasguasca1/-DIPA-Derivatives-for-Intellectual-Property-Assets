Concept explanation: 

Artists get paid by the monetisation of the copyrights they own. 
This work is done by music publishers that own the right to exploit those assets. 
More often than not copyright owners offer for sale the ownership of those assets in order to 
get liquidity providing the buyer with a future income mirroring the way bonds work. 

DIPA (Derivatives for Intellectual Property Assets) is an Ethereum defi implementation aiming to do the exact same thing 
by opening the window for more people to be part of the staking pool that is created from a copyright. 
The perfect way to do this is with defi. Given the great tools the blockchain provides, is feasible to 
put this IP tokens into an open offer for anyone who is interested in acquiring a portion of such IP assets future income for the long-term. 
The estimation of the staking price and the way to split the royalties benefit will be made based on 
data points the creators will bring as well a expectations from the public in general. 
At the end of the day, every time a song you have a stake on is played you will be profiting from it.

Summary: IP assets that are already tokenized would be accessible on our platform for derivatives 
solutions such as the sale of a bond based on the performance of the intrinsic asset.
